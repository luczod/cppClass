#### The Beauty of CMake
- The real beauty of CMake is revealed when you know that it can generate buid files for other build systems, not just Make, but also:
    - Ninja
    - Visual Studio
    - XCode

#### Ninja - Make Alternative
- Ninja is yet another build system. It takes as input the interdependencies of files (build.ninja) and orchestrates building them, quickly.
- Its distinguishing goal is to be fast. It is born from work on the Chromium browser project, which has over 30000 source fiels and whose other build systems would take ten secondes to start building after changing one file. Ninja is under a second.
- Ninja is meant replace Make.
- It is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system like CMake.
