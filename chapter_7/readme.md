### Logical Opertators
- Each performs a Boolean operation at the bit level and returns an integral type matching its operands.
- Shorter integral types are promoted to int types.
- Integral types can also be promoted to floating-point types during arithmetic operation.
- C++ is a bit overzealous in silently converting types.

### casting and promotion
- Casting is when you have an object of one type and need to convert it to another type.
- Promotion is the set of rules for interpreting literals.
- braced initialization doesn’t permit narrowing conversions.

### Member Access Operators
- subscript [], indirection *, address-of &, member-of-object ., and member-of-pointer ->
- literals: constant values that you use directly in your programs

### Buckets
- When you request memory, the environment allocates a whole bucket, even if you didn’t request all the memory.
