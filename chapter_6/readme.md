### Templates
- C++ achieves compile-time polymorphism through templates.
- A template is a class or function with template parameters
- You declare templates with a template prefix(angle brackets < >)
- the template parameters(any type, int, user-defined class...)

### Static cast
- The reason you might need static_cast is that, generally, implicit casts arenâ€™t reversible.
- Narrow_cast, it is a homemade explicit templated conversion function,
- Used when values could be narrowed throwing an exception in this case, whereas static_cast doesn't throw one.

### Generic programming
- Templates allow the compiler to instantiate a custom class or function based
on the types in use
