### Namespaces

- Namespaces prevent naming conflicts. In large projects or when importing libraries,
- Namespaces are essential for disambiguating exactly the symbols you’re looking for.
- By default, all symbols you declare go into the global namespace.
- Use the scope-resolution "::" operator to specify the fully qualified name of a symbol.
- This allows you to prevent naming conflicts in large projects or when you’re using a thirdparty library.
